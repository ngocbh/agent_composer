# Seed gallery — Agent Composer flow syntax

These are **example flows in the `Agent Composer` contract** (the Compose-inspired,
edge-free, single-value I/O model from
`docs/plans/2026-06-10-engine-json-io-redesign-design.md` → §0c). They load and
run via the Compose loader (`agent_composer.load_flow` / `run_flow`); the CODE
nodes call `tests.seeds.fns`.

> Flows that need not-yet-supported features (REF/MAP runtime · M8, `${system.run_id}`,
> MATCH, `depends_on`, HUMAN_INPUT/WAIT) live under `_future/` until their milestone lands.

The goal: every feature and every syntax convention shows up in at least one seed, so the
gallery doubles as the spec.

## The shape of a flow

A flow is a function `'a -> 'b`. A file is **Docker-Compose-shaped**: metadata scalars, then
the flow's interface and body as **top-level sections** — no `edges:`, no `__start__`/`__end__`
nodes, no per-node `id:`, no body wrappers.

```yaml
id: …            # metadata
name: …
description: …
input:  { … }   # the flow's parameters   — source types (+ default/optional)
nodes:   { … }   # the body — a MAP keyed by node id
output: { … }   # the flow's return       — sink bindings
asserts: [ … ]   # optional — boolean checks over ${inputs}/${outputs}
x-…:             # optional — extension keys, ignored by the engine
```

- **`input:`** is the parameter signature (source side — types). **`output:`** is the return
  (sink side — bindings). Because `output:` can bind from several nodes, multi-output flows are
  natural (the flow returns one object); there is no single-terminal rule.
- Flow-input refs are `${input.X}`. The return is never referenced — nothing reads the "output
  node" (there isn't one).

## One value in, one value out

Every node (and the flow) produces **exactly one value** — a scalar, an **object**, or a
**list**. "Several outputs" = fields of one object. There are no per-key node outputs.

## No `edges:` — the graph is inferred

| Edge kind | Inferred from |
|---|---|
| **data** | a `${X.output}` ref inside a node's `input:` (also `over:` / `on:` / `when:`) |
| **control** | a `case` node's `then:` / `else:` targets |
| **ordering** | an explicit `depends_on: [id, …]` (run-after with no data binding — side effects) |

A cycle is a compile error.

## Node anatomy — flat bodies, keyed by id

`nodes:` is a **map keyed by the node id** (the key *is* the id — no `id:` field). The body is
**flat**: `kind:` + the kind's own fields, no `agent:`/`code:`/… wrapper.

```yaml
nodes:
  score:                       # ← the node id (map key)
    kind: agent
    node_name: Relevance score  # optional — a human display label
    depends_on: [warmup]       # optional — explicit ordering edge(s)
    input:                    # sink bindings (consumed)
      topic: ${input.topic}
    output: float             # source type (produced) — Python typing
    prompt: "…"                # ← kind field, flat on the node
```

Per kind, the flat fields are: **agent** → `prompt` (+ future tools/mode/llm_config); **code**
→ `code: module:function`; **call** → `call:` + `input:` (a single application); **map** →
`call:` + `over:` + `input:` (+ `parallel:`) — `List.map` over the `over:` list, `${item}` per
element; **case** → `cases:` + `else:` (+ `on:`). `model` / `tool` land in the next batch.

A `call` also has an **inline form** — `${ f(arg=${ref}, k=lit) }` written inside any binding
(a node input, a TOOL `arg:`, a `map`'s `over:`, a flow output). It is sugar: it desugars
**at load** into an anonymous `call` node and the host binding becomes `${<that node>.output}`.
Keyword args only; each arg value is a full binding (a `${…}` ref/coalesce, else a YAML-scalar
literal); a nested `${ g(…) }` arg desugars inner-first. It cannot capture `${item}` (the synth
node has no map-element scope — use a named `map` node with `over:`). Seed 21.

## Declarations are native YAML — source side = types, sink side = bindings

The YAML *value* of a declared field is read as-is, recursively:

| Where | Side | The value is a … |
|---|---|---|
| `node.output:` | source (produced) | **type** (Python annotation) |
| top-level `input:` | source (parameters) | **type** (`Optional[X]` = nullable; `TYPE = default`) |
| `node.input:` | sink (consumed) | **binding** |
| top-level `output:` | sink (returned) | **binding** |
| `call:` `input:` | sink (call args) | **binding** |

**Types** (source side) — annotations are **Python `typing`**. A string leaf is a scalar/generic; a
map is a record (a dataclass — fields recurse):
```yaml
output: str                              # scalar: str / int / float / bool / date (Any = opaque)
output: list[str]                        # generic: list[X], dict[K, V], Optional[X]
output: { decision: str, why: str }      # record (inline — OK: no [ ] or ${…} inside)
output:                                  # record (block style — identical)
  decision: str
  why: str
output:                                  # nested record
  rating: float
  meta: { source: str, asof: date }
```
(Anonymous inline records **are field-checked** at compile time, like named records — a dotted read
of a field the record doesn't declare is a compile error (C-ANON-CHECK, as of the M7 loader). Only
`Any` stays opaque. Naming a type in `typedefs:` adds reuse + cross-flow structural equivalence, not
"more checking". *(Updated 2026-06-13 — superseded the earlier "anon records are opaque" draft.)*)

**Bindings** (sink side) — a reference, a literal, an operator form, or a coalesce (see below).

## User-defined types (`typedefs:`)

A top-level `typedefs:` section lets a flow **name and compose** types, **Python-typing style** — a
record is a *dataclass*, annotations use `typing`:

```yaml
typedefs:
  Topic: str                          # STRING = alias (any type expression)
  Bundle: list[Topic]                 #   aliases compose -> list[str]
  Amount: float
  Category: Literal[pro, con, mixed]  # enum
  Choice:                             # tagged (payload) union: a sequence of bare-tag | {tag: payload}
    - defer
    - approve: { count: int }
    - reject: RejectInfo
  RejectInfo:                         # MAP = record (a dataclass — field: annotation)
    count: int
    limit: Amount
  Rating:
    category: Category
    score: float
    note: Optional[str]               # nullable field
  Plan:
    rating: Rating
    history: list[Rating]             # list over a user type
```

Use a type name anywhere a type is expected (`input:`, a node `output:`); dotted access into a
named record is **type-checked at compile time** (`${analyze.output.rating.category}`). Rules:

- **Scalars** are Python: `str`/`int`/`float`/`bool`, plus `date`; opaque = `Any`. **Generics**:
  `list[X]`, `Optional[X]`, `dict[K, V]`.
- **Enums** are `Literal[a, b, c]` (tag-only) — routed by `case … on`. **Tagged unions** are a
  sequence with **≥1 payload** case (`{tag: payload}`, bare tags allowed alongside) — destructured by
  the **`MATCH`** node (exhaustive + payload binding; deferred). An **all-bare-tags sequence is not
  allowed** — use `Literal[…]` (one spelling per meaning).
- **Names**: PascalCase; must not shadow a scalar (`str`/`int`/…/`date`) **or** a typing constructor
  (`Any`/`Optional`/`Literal`/`Union`/`List`/`Dict`).
- **Equivalence** across REF/MAP boundaries is **structural**; **recursive** (and alias-cycle) defs
  are rejected. `list[<payload-union>]` is rejected (it would drop payloads).
- *Status:* the Compose loader maps Python names → the engine's types; scalars, `list[X]`, **all-required**
  records, `Literal` enums, and aliases resolve on the existing resolver. Still needing engine work:
  **`Optional` record-fields** (per-field nullable bit), **`dict[K, V]`**, and **payload unions + the
  `MATCH` node**.

## References & interpolation

| Form | Means |
|---|---|
| `${input.X}` | a field of the flow's input |
| `${<node>.output}` | node `<node>`'s whole value |
| `${<node>.output.field[.sub]}` | dot into an object value |
| `${<case>.output}` | a `case` node's **taken-branch value** (desugars to a coalesce over its branch targets) |
| `${item}` | inside a `map` node body only (`kind: map` with `over:`) — the current element |
| `${system.X}` | host-ambient (run id / clock / tenant); reserved |
| `${name}` (bare) | **inside an AGENT prompt or a `case` `when:`** — that node's own declared input `name` |

**Operator forms** inside `${…}` (bash/Compose family + our coalesce):

| Form | Means |
|---|---|
| `${X:-default}` | value, else `default` if X is null/absent |
| `${X:?err}` | value, else **fail** with message `err` (required) |
| `${a \| b \| c}` | first-present among **peers** — n-ary coalesce (branch-joins) |
| `$$` | a literal `$` (escape; not interpolated) |

Nesting is allowed: `${a:-${b:-lit}}`. Rule of thumb: `:-` for *value-or-default*, `|` for
*whichever-ran*.

**Whole-string vs embedded:** a value that is *exactly* `${ref}` resolves to the **typed** value
(could be a list/object); a `${ref}` embedded in surrounding text is **stringified**. So
`briefs: ${map.output}` is a real list; `"see ${map.output}"` is its string form.

## Bindings must be block form (not inline)

Bindings are **unquoted, one per line**. They must **not** sit in an inline flow-mapping
(`input: { topic: ${…} }`) — there the `}` in `${…}` (or a `[` from `list[…]`/`Literal[…]`/
`Union[…]`/`dict[…]`) would break the map. Always use block form for `input:`/`output:`/`call`
maps, and for any record/payload with a generic-typed field. (Quoted values — an AGENT
`prompt:`, a `case` `when:` — *may* stay inline; their quotes protect the `}`.)

## Three expression contexts

| Context | Grammar |
|---|---|
| **Bindings** (`input:`/`output:` values) | `${ref}` / literal / `:-` `:?` / `\|`. **No arithmetic** — transforms go in nodes. |
| **`when:` / `asserts:`** | boolean (`== != < <= > >= in not in`, `and`/`or`/`not`, parens) over operands that may use **simple arithmetic** (`+ - * / %`, parens, unary minus). Numbers only; **no function calls**. |
| **Prompts** | free text with embedded `${name}` (stringified). |

"Bindings wire, conditions test, nodes compute."

## Branching — the `case` node (SQL CASE)

A `case` node **routes only** (no `input:`). Two forms, like SQL:

```yaml
gate:                            # searched form — each when: is a boolean
  kind: case
  cases:
    - when: "${score.output} >= 0.5"
      then: positive
  else: cautious                 # unconditional fallback

route:                           # simple form — match a value with on:
  kind: case
  on: ${classify.output}
  cases:
    - when: pro                 # here when: is a VALUE to match (not a boolean)
      then: pro_note
    - when: con
      then: con_note
  else: mixed_note
```

Exactly one branch runs; the others are skip-flooded and never write a value, so a join uses a
coalesce to pick whichever ran: `${pro_note.output | con_note.output | mixed_note.output}`.
The **value-case shorthand `${<case>.output}`** is sugar for exactly this coalesce over the
case's branch targets (= the taken branch's value; seed 22).

## Defaults / optionality

`Optional[X]` (nullable — *type-level*) and `= default` (omission-fill — *binding-level*) are
**orthogonal**, not a choice. A top-level param is:

- **required** ⇔ its type is **not** `Optional` **and** it has **no** `= default` (`topic: str`).
  Omitting a required param is the only hard error.
- **`Optional[date]`** (no default) → omitted yields **null**.
- **`window: int = 30`** → omitted yields **30** (the RHS is always a YAML literal, never a type ref).
- **`Optional[date] = today`** is legal: omitted → `today`; an explicitly-passed null is allowed.

A flow input is therefore **either** a string annotation (`TYPE` / `TYPE = literal` / `Optional[TYPE]`)
**or** — for a **record/object default** — a `{type:, default:}` **map** (inline `TYPE = {…}` breaks YAML
on the `:` inside the literal). The map form is the structured-default escape hatch; `default:` is native
YAML, `type:` may be `Optional[…]`:
```yaml
input:
  budget: Amount = 1000.0          # string form — scalar default
  bundle: Bundle = ["ACME"]       # string form — simple-list default
  prior:                          # map form — structured (record) default
    type: Rating
    default: { category: pro, score: 0.0, rationale: neutral }
```

Applied at every flow boundary (top-level run + a REF/MAP child seeding its own params). Defaults live
on flow `input:` only — internal nodes never declare defaults; a sink that may be absent uses
`${X:-default}` or a coalesce `${a | b}` (e.g. to pick whichever `case` branch ran). *(Distinct layers:
`= default` / the `{type:, default:}` map set a **parameter's** default in the signature; `${X:-default}`
is a **use-site** fallback for a possibly-null reference.)*

## Constraints — the `asserts:` section

No `min`/`max`/`options`/`label` on fields. Value constraints (range, enum membership,
required, cross-field invariants) are a top-level **`asserts:`** list of boolean checks over
`${input.X}` / `${node.output}`; any false fails the run.
```yaml
asserts:
  - ${input.topics} != []                 # non-empty
  - ${input.window} * 2 <= 365           # arithmetic is allowed here
```

## Extensibility — anchors + `x-`

The schema is strict (`extra='forbid'`) **except** keys matching `x-*`, which it ignores. Use
them for custom metadata and to park reusable YAML anchor blocks:
```yaml
x-agent-defaults: &agent_defaults    # parked under x- so the strict schema ignores it
  output: str
nodes:
  pro:
    kind: agent
    <<: *agent_defaults              # merged in by YAML before the engine sees it
    input:
      topic: ${input.topic}
    prompt: "…"
```

| `13-types-objects.yaml` | the type grammar — Python scalars, `list[X]`, inline/block/nested objects (records), deep dotted access |
| `14-agent-tools.yaml` | AGENT knobs — `mode` / `tools` / `controls` (`ask_user`) / `llm_config` + structured output |

| `23-asserts-scopes.yaml` | **asserts at every scope**: FLOW (boundary/post + a span-wrapped inline `${ call(...) }`), DEF-child (a `defs:` callable's `asserts:`, enforced at the call seam), and NODE (per-node contract — `${name}` PRE, `${output}` POST) |

Every node kind (AGENT/CODE/MODEL/TOOL/call/case) and every settled convention appears in
at least one seed; the effects (`HUMAN_INPUT`/`WAIT`) are **pinned as a DRAFT proposal**
(17) ahead of building them. Tagged data is modelled as a discriminant record (a `Literal`
field) routed by `case … on <field>` — the `kind: match` + payload-union design was dropped.

## Negative gallery — `errors/`

`errors/` holds flows that are **supposed to fail**, at compile **or** at runtime — they pin
Agent Composer's **L3 "loud + located errors"** and are the loader's negative test fixtures
(`tests/engine/test_errors.py`).

**The rule:** every feature here gets accompanying error fixtures in `errors/` covering its
expected **compile-time** (`load_flow` → `LoadError`, located at the `.yaml` line) **and
runtime** (`run_flow` → `status="failed"`) failure modes that the engine can actually capture;
each isolates one failure, with a matching test. Failure modes whose check isn't built yet live
in `_future/errors/` with their milestone. See `errors/README.md` for the full table and rule.

**Deferred / still to build:** `MATCH` and `HUMAN_INPUT`/`WAIT` are **proposed** here (16/17)
but not yet in the authoritative §0c decisions, and the loader is unbuilt — treat their exact
syntax as *for review*. The `tests.seeds.fns` CODE module now owes, in addition to
`one_line_summary` / `fetch_facts` / `prime_cache` / `build_outline` (seeds 01/03/12/13):
`confirm_action` (seed 17). *(The `errors/`
fixtures need no owed fns — they fail before/without running a CODE callable.)*

## Locked conventions (revise here)

All settled this session and recorded in design §0c — Compose-style top-level
`input:`/`nodes:`/`output:`/`asserts:`; no `edges:`/`__start__`/`__end__`; keyed `nodes:` map
with flat bodies; `case`/`when`/`then`/`else`/`on`; references `${…}` with `:-`/`:?`/`|`
and `$$` escape; unquoted block-form bindings; strict schema + `x-*` + YAML anchors; and a
**Python-typing** type system (`str`/`int`/`float`/`bool`, `list[X]`/`Optional[X]`, dataclass
records, `Literal` enums, sequence payload-unions, inline `TYPE = default`) — `typedefs:` registry (C10).
