"""Guard: no legacy reference-vocabulary heads remain after the rename.

The JSON-IO single-value redesign unified the legacy `node` and
`ref_outputs` reference heads into a single `outputs` head. This test fails if any
legacy brace-wrapped `node.`/`ref_outputs.` reference literal survives in the engine
source, the seed gallery, or the test fixtures — the concrete red->green rating for
an otherwise mechanical sweep. (The needles are built dynamically below so this
guard file never matches itself.)

Scope: `calpha/` (engine + seeds) and `tests/`. The design docs under `docs/`
legitimately discuss the old vocabulary historically and are not scanned.
