"""End-to-end pause/resume across the three `human_input` question surfaces.

A `human_input` gate suspends the run with a `HumanInputRequired.questions` list and
resumes when the host delivers a record keyed by each question's `header`. The three
ways the gate sources its questions:

  (A) static     — a literal `questions:` list in the YAML (seed 26).
  (C) manual ref — a `code` node produces the list, fed via `questions: ${qs}`.
  (B) adaptive   — an `adaptive_questions:` block that desugars at load into a synth
                   compose-agent + the gate; the agent authors the list.

Each test runs to the pause, asserts the carried questions, delivers an answer record,
and resumes to a succeeded terminal. The static and manual-ref forms need no LLM; the
adaptive form monkeypatches `model_from_config` with a fake structured-output chat.
