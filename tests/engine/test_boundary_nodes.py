"""The boundary flip: the loader synthesizes real START_ID/END_ID NODES into every
flow (the __start__/__end__ sentinels retire — the strings persist as the reserved node ids), the
engine reads END_ID's committed value as the run result, START_ID is seeded at engine init, and
${input.X} resolves to store[START_ID]. Assertions check the NODES exist + edges carry real
adjacency, never that the strings are absent (they ARE the node ids).
