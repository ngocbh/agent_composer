"""Agent pause = continuation — full loader->engine round-trips.

A stub model drives the agent loop; each `ask_user` control call lowers to a
continuation PAIR (a `human_input` leaf + a resume continuation — an `AgentNode` with a
`Resume` entry) via `Enqueue`, the engine's single AGENT arm of `_apply_enqueue` clones it
namespaced at the spawner, the human_input leaf parks, and the deliver-as-Output resume
feeds the answer into the resume continuation. These tests pin: the pause->resume->finish round trip, no
replay of turn 1 (the carried memo is replayed as messages, not re-invoked — asserted
via the stub call count), a 2-pause agent does not deadlock, and a many-pause agent
(> MAX_REF_DEPTH pauses) does NOT trip MAX_REF_DEPTH (the agent arm carries the parent
depth UNCHANGED — it is bounded by MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS / MAX_TOTAL_NODES).
