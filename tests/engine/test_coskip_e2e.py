"""End-to-end (Ollama-free): co-skip + `:-null` escape + ref-coalesce join.

A CODE-bodied flow that exercises all three data stances through a real `case` route, so
the veto + co-skip run via the full loader -> engine path (not just hand-built edges):

- `pro` / `con` are the two branches (only one runs).
- `pro_detail` reads a PLAIN `${pro.output}` -> co-skips when `pro` is skipped.
- `assemble` joins `${pro.output | con.output}` (survives, binds the taken branch) and
  `${pro_detail.output:-null}` (optional escape -> binds null when `pro_detail` co-skips).
