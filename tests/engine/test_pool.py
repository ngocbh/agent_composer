"""Unit tests for TypedVariablePool.

Feature -> contract:
- set / get_segment / get                : typed read/write of a node's single value
- resolve(head, rest)                   : backs ${...}; structured traversal
- set with declared type                : write-time type-drift detection
- dumps / loads                         : lossless full-pool round-trip
