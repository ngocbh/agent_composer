"""`case` `then:/else: ${call}` inline-call branch targets.

A branch target may be an inline call (a fresh owned call) instead of a placed node id; it
desugars to a synth `__call_<n>` node and the then:/else: is rewritten to that synth id. Sound
because the case veto skip-floods the non-chosen synth branch. Accepted grammar: a single bare
whole-span `${call}` (a route target is one node id).
