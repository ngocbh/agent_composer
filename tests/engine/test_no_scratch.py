"""Structural-purity lock-in: scratch is fully eliminated.

AGENT rides its memo as graph data (the resume_agent continuation) and R
delivers HUMAN_INPUT/WAIT answers as the parked leaf's Output — so NO node reads scratch.
This pins that the field + helpers are gone and that no node source even references the
word `scratch`.
