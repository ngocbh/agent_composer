"""Engine event vocabulary — shared by nodes, the runtime, and callers.

Two tiers (graphon's "two-tier event model"):

- **Node events** are produced by `Node.run()`. A node emits `NodeStarted`, then
  optionally `StreamChunk`s (token streaming) and/or a `PauseRequested`, and
  terminates with `NodeSucceeded` or `NodeFailed`. The node only *describes* its
  one output value on `NodeSucceeded.output`; the engine — not the node — writes
  it into the variable pool. That split keeps nodes pure and testable.

- **Run events** are produced by `FlowEngine.run()` and streamed to the caller
  (the CLI): `RunStarted` then one terminal of
  `RunSucceeded | RunFailed | RunPaused | RunAborted`.

Plain dataclasses, not pydantic: these are transient in-process signals, never
serialized (what *is* serialized is the checkpoint, which captures pause
*reasons*, not events).

`PauseReason` is typed in `suspension.pause`; referenced here as `Any` to keep
`events` a dependency-free leaf alongside `state`.
