"""`run_flow(loaded, inputs) -> RunResult` — the run entrypoint.

A host-agnostic run boundary that drives a loaded `LoadedFlow` through the
`FlowEngine` and enforces its `asserts:` in two phases. It owns the run-input
concerns the pure graph engine doesn't:

- coerce + default the run arguments against the flow's `InputDecl`s,
- seed the `input` namespace + the host-ambient `system` clock,
- fire the BOUNDARY asserts (`${input}`/`${system}`-only) BEFORE any node runs
  (fail-fast), and the POST-TERMINAL asserts (`${<id>.output}`) AFTER the run
  reaches a terminal — flipping a succeeded run to `failed` on a false post assert.

`RunResult` (the surface-agnostic run outcome) lives here, beside `run_flow`. The
seeding fns (`coerce_inputs`/`apply_defaults`/`seed_system_clock`) come from
`state.seeding`; the run's clock is the `${system.today}`/`${system.now}` ambients
(a flow reads "as of" via `Optional[date]` + `:-`/`${system.today}`).

Never raises on a flow failure — a failed/aborted run, or a false assert, comes back as
a `RunResult` with `status != "succeeded"` (RunFailed is an engine EVENT, not an
exception). Compile-time errors (a bad flow) are surfaced by `load_flow`, not here.

Imports flow DOWN only: `runtime` (FlowEngine), `state` (the pool + seeding),
`expr` (evaluate_when), `events`, and the sibling `loader` (LoadedFlow). Nothing
imports back.

    including failures and pauses; these functions never raise on a flow failure.

    Attributes:
        input (`dict[str, Any]`):
            The coerced run-argument dict (singular, for symmetry across surfaces).
            Empty `{}` on a resume, which carries no fresh run arguments.
        status (`str`):
            The terminal state: one of `"succeeded"`, `"failed"`, `"paused"`, or
            `"aborted"`.
        output (`Any`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The flow's single terminal value — a scalar or a multi-field object.
            Set only when `status == "succeeded"`.
        error (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Human-readable failure detail. Set only when `status == "failed"`
            (including a false post-terminal assert).
        events (`list[Any]`):
            The raw engine event objects, in emission order. A host serializes them
            however it sees fit.
        checkpoint (`Any`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            A serializable `RunCheckpoint` for durable, cross-process resume. Set
            only when `status == "paused"`.
        engine (`FlowEngine`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The live engine for fast in-process resume. Set only when
            `status == "paused"`.
        pause_reasons (`list[Any]`):
            The self-addressing `PauseReason`s to act on before resuming. Non-empty

            A compiled, validated flow from [`load_flow`][agent_composer.load_flow].

        inputs (`dict[str, Any]`):
            Run arguments keyed by declared input name. Each value is coerced to its
            declared type; names omitted here fall back to their declared defaults.
        run_id (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Host-injected run id, readable in the flow as `${system.run_id}`. When
            `None`, a fresh id is minted per run.
        on_event (`Callable[[Any], None]`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
