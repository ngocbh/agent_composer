"""Tool registry + the ``@register_tool`` decorator.

A tool self-registers by decorating its implementation; importing the module
that defines it populates ``TOOL_REGISTRY`` as a side effect. The engine's TOOL
node and the AGENT tool-calling loop look tools up here by id.

This is the package's tool *seam*: the core ships no domain tools — a host
application registers its own (e.g. ``@register_tool("add")``). Tool ids must be
unique across everything registered into the process.
