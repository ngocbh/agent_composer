"""PauseReason — a discriminated union describing *what a suspended node awaits*.

This is the typed payload on `PauseRequested` and the thing a checkpoint persists
so a scheduler/watcher knows when to wake the run. Adding a new way to wait is a
new subclass, nothing else.

Maps to the user-facing surface:
- HUMAN_INPUT node          -> HumanInputRequired (re-prompt on resume)
- WATCH composite's WAIT     -> EventAwaited (watcher fires -> resume)
- a plain timed wait         -> ScheduledPause
