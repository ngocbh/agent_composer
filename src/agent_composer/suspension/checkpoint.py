"""RunCheckpoint — the serializable envelope that makes a run resumable.

The graph *topology* is intentionally NOT stored (it is rebuilt from the flow
spec), keeping checkpoints small and decoupled from code changes to node bodies.
Only run state is captured:

- `pool`            — the typed variable pool (lossless via AnySegment tags)
- `node_state` / `edge_state` — per-node/edge scheduling state
- `paused_nodes`    — parked leaves; stay TAKEN, the stored answer is delivered as Output on resume (no re-run)
- `deferred_nodes`  — became ready while suspending; enqueue on resume
- `pause_reasons`   — what each paused node awaits (drives the watcher/CLI)
- `expansions`      — descriptor tree for runtime-grown subgraphs (replayed on restore)

A round-trip through `dumps()`/`loads()` reconstructs an equivalent run in any
process.

# Checkpoint blob schema version. 1.0 -> 2.0: the single-value store migration

# inputs-namespace retirement: `pool.inputs` is gone — `${input.X}`
# resolves via `store[START_ID]` — so the serialized pool shape changed.
# 3.0 -> 4.0: the type-surface rename (the `SegmentType.value` tags moved to the one
# Python-surface vocabulary, `str`/`int`/`float`/`bool`/..., so a pre-4.0 blob's
# `value_type` tags are unreadable by the AnySegment discriminated union). A pre-4.0
# blob is NOT loadable. 4.0 -> 5.0: adds the additive `expansions` field (the
# descriptor tree for runtime-grown subgraphs; defaults []). A 4.0 body is otherwise
# wire-compatible — `pause_reasons` is unchanged — but pre-5.0 blobs are rejected as a
# forward-compat hard cutover: this is the first build to write/expect the field, and a
# pre-5.0 checkpoint of a grown run carries no descriptors for the (forthcoming) replay.
# Pre-5.0 blobs are NOT loadable.

        ready (`list[str]`, *optional*, defaults to `[]`):
            Node ids that were ready to run at suspend time; re-enqueued on resume.
        node_state (`dict[str, NodeState]`, *optional*, defaults to `{}`):
            Per-node scheduling state at suspend time.

        expansions (`list[Expansion]`, *optional*, defaults to `[]`):
