"""FlowEngine — one engine, one knob (`num_workers`).

A producer/consumer engine with two drive modes behind a single `num_workers`
knob, sharing one set of state-mutation helpers (`_on_success`/`_on_pause`/
`_advance`/`_branch`/`_skip_edge`):

- `num_workers=0` (default) — the single-threaded inline drain: the caller's
  thread pops the ready queue, runs each node's generator inline, applies the
  consequences, and forwards events. This is the deterministic path (exact event
  ordering, no `event_q` hop); golden-locked in F0.
- `num_workers>=1` — a fixed worker pool with a single-writer dispatcher: N
  daemon workers pull ids off `ready_q`, run `eval_node`, and push events onto
  `event_q`; the dispatcher (`run()`'s generator) drains `event_q`, forwards each
  event, and applies the *same* mutation helpers. The dispatcher is the sole
  writer of graph/edge/pool state.

Both modes capture all of graphon's *correctness* (3-state edge join, exact-once
fan-in, outputs-before-successors, branch skip-flood). The in-memory
`resume()` is serial-only (`num_workers==0`).

Load-bearing orderings (do not reorder):
- A node's outputs are written to the pool **before** any successor is scheduled.
- A successor is scheduled only when `disposition` (via `is_node_ready`) says it is
  ready — an edge-class-aware join: a diamond fires exactly once, a control edge
  hard-gates (veto) and a required data group co-skips; a `dead` head is
  skip-flooded by `_skip_edge`.

        top-level descriptor (`is_top_level`) is appended to `self.expansions`; a nested one is
        ALREADY attached under its parent's slot by deserialization, so the fold only walks it.
        The append decision is keyed on `is_top_level` (NOT on `parent_depth == 0`): an AGENT
        carries depth UNCHANGED, so a future child of a top-level AGENT segment would still have
        `parent_depth == 0` yet must NOT be promoted to a top-level ledger entry. The `_grow_*`
