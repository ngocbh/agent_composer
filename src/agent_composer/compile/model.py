"""The compiled flow graph: nodes, edges, adjacency, and the node-state vocabulary.

`CompiledFlow` is immutable topology — the nodes and how they connect. All mutable run
state (which nodes/edges were taken or skipped) lives in the runtime's state manager, so one
`CompiledFlow` can back many independent runs. `NodeState` is the per-node state vocabulary
the runtime tracks against that topology.

`START_ID` / `END_ID` are the reserved boundary-node ids. Every flow begins with a synthesized
START node (which binds the run inputs) and ends with a synthesized END node (whose value is the
flow's result). They are owned canonically by the node classes (`StartNode.ID` / `EndNode.ID`)
and re-exported here so runtime consumers can import them alongside the graph types.

    The immutable compiled graph: nodes, edges, adjacency, and flow-owned input wiring.

    Topology only — it holds no run state, so one instance can back many independent runs.
    All mutable per-run state (which nodes/edges were taken or skipped) lives in the
    runtime's state manager. The sole mutation is [`add_subgraph`][agent_composer.CompiledFlow.add_subgraph],
    the runtime's append-only overlay used when a spawner node expands the graph at run time.

    Attributes:
        nodes (`dict[str, Node]`):
            Map of node id to its `Node`. Includes the synthesized `START`/`END` boundary
            nodes plus every authored node.
        edges (`list[Edge]`):
            All directed edges. Carries data edges (a producer output feeding a consumer
            input group) and pure control/ordering edges alike.
        outputs (`list[FlowOutput]`):
            The declared `outputs:`; empty means the flow falls back to the raw terminal
            node value.
        wiring (`dict[str, dict[str, Any]]`):
            Authoritative input wiring `wiring[node_id][param] -> source`, where source is
            a `${...}` binding string or a literal. `edges` is its derived data-flow
            projection.
        flow_llm_config (`dict[str, Any]`):
            The flow's authored `llm_config:` model-selection defaults (the cascade's flow
            layer); `{}` when absent. `resolve_llm_cascade` gap-fills each agent's effective
