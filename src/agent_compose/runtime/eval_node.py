"""eval_node — the engine's node-evaluation seam.

A node is a pure function of its bound input record; the ENGINE owns both boundaries —
the read (bind the inputs from the pool) and the write (the dispatcher stores `Output`).
This generator is that read seam plus the assert + dispatch normalization, lifted out of
the node (it replaces the temporary `Node._emit`). It yields `NodeStarted`, binds the
record, pre-resolves reserved keys (timed WAIT `until` / mapped-call `over`), builds the per-kind
narrow caps (only a mapped call's `bind_item` now — no node uses a private namespace), runs the node,
and turns the returned `NodeResult` into one terminal `NodeSucceeded`/`NodeFailed` — or a
single `PauseRequested` for a returned `Pause`.

Every node-side failure path funnels to `NodeFailed` so the two engines (serial + parallel)
agree byte-for-byte on the same input: a node `raise`, an `Enqueue` returned by a NON-spawner
kind, and a non-`NodeResult` return all become `NodeFailed` inside the `try` — none
escape the generator uncaught. (A spawner's `Enqueue` instead becomes `NodeExpanded`.)

The bind is PURE: it reads the node's sources ONLY from `flow.wiring[node.id]` joined to the
node's `params` — the node carries no source. Direct-drive tests supply a stub `flow` with
`wiring` (the test helpers derive it). Layer: runtime imports nodes.* freely.

Accepted bind ordering vs the old per-node `_run` (both on states a loaded flow cannot reach,
both still terminating in `NodeFailed`): a timed WAIT re-resolves `until` on every path including
release/resume (harmless given the monotonic pool), and a `call` that is BOTH unbaked AND has a
bad `over`/binding surfaces the over/bind error before the not-baked guard (loader always bakes).
