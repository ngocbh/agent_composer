"""Flow-input default seeding — shared by the run boundary and REF/MAP children.

The Compose run boundary coerces + defaults the top-level run args; a REF/MAP child
runs via the engine (not the boundary), so its `_run` reuses `apply_defaults` to fill
the child's own declared defaults for omitted args. The clock reaches children through
the inherited `pool.system` (`${system.today}`/`${system.now}`) — there is no separate
`as_of` clock special-case.

Lives in the engine layer so the nodes can import it without an import-direction
inversion. It is spec-free at runtime — it duck-types the declared-input decls
(`.name`/`.type`/`.default`); the `InputDecl` it operates on is the Compose loader's.
