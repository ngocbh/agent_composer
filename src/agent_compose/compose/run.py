"""`run_flow(loaded, inputs) -> RunResult` — the run entrypoint.

A host-agnostic run boundary that drives a loaded `LoadedFlow` through the
`FlowEngine` and enforces its `asserts:` in two phases. It owns the run-input
concerns the pure graph engine doesn't:

- coerce + default the run arguments against the flow's `InputDecl`s,
- seed the `input` namespace + the host-ambient `system` clock,
- fire the BOUNDARY asserts (`${input}`/`${system}`-only) BEFORE any node runs
  (fail-fast), and the POST-TERMINAL asserts (`${<id>.output}`) AFTER the run
  reaches a terminal — flipping a succeeded run to `failed` on a false post assert.

`RunResult` (the surface-agnostic run outcome) lives here, beside `run_flow`. The
seeding fns (`coerce_inputs`/`apply_defaults`/`seed_system_clock`) come from
`state.seeding`; the run's clock is the `${system.today}`/`${system.now}` ambients
(a flow reads "as of" via `Optional[date]` + `:-`/`${system.today}`).

Never raises on a flow failure — a failed/aborted run, or a false assert, comes back as
a `RunResult` with `status != "succeeded"` (RunFailed is an engine EVENT, not an
exception). Compile-time errors (a bad flow) are surfaced by `load_flow`, not here.

Imports flow DOWN only: `runtime` (FlowEngine), `state` (the pool + seeding),
`expr` (evaluate_when), `events`, and the sibling `loader` (LoadedFlow). Nothing
imports back.
