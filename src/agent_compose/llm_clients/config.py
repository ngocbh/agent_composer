"""LLMConfig — per-AGENT model selection (the carrier `model_from_config` resolves).

Lives with the clients that consume it: the AGENT node and the Compose loader's
`llm_config:` field carry an `LLMConfig` (or the plain dict that normalizes to one),
and `factory.model_from_config` turns it into a ready chat model. Was in the
agent_compose `common/` grab-bag before this cleanup; moved here because it IS the
clients' input contract.
