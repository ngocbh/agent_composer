"""Commands — external control delivered to a (possibly suspended) run.

`DeliverAnswerCommand` is the vehicle an external watcher/human uses to satisfy a
pause: it delivers the awaited value (the human's answer, the external-event
payload) to the parked leaf as that leaf's `Output` (deliver-as-Output).
`AbortCommand` terminates a run.
