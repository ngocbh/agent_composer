"""Expansion descriptors — durability metadata for runtime-grown subgraphs.

These land the kill-recovery half of durable suspension. The WRITE half: a node returning
`Enqueue` (REF / CALL / MAP / AGENT-pause) grows the live graph at runtime; the dispatcher
captures each expansion as one of these descriptors and accumulates them in an ordered
ledger on `FlowEngine.expansions`, which `snapshot()` persists. The READ half
(`FlowEngine._replay_expansions`): on restore the engine **replays the descriptor tree
top-down** via the shared `_grow_*` clone+register helpers (effects suppressed), using the
pure id minting (`ns(callsite, child_id)`) to re-key every cloned subnode identically — so a
run paused mid-expansion resumes in a fresh process.

Closed sum (one variant per spawner kind, mirroring `_apply_enqueue`'s arms):

- `CallExpansion(spawner_id, record, children)` — REF/CALL spawned ONE child.
- `MapExpansion(spawner_id, records, children_per_element)` — MAP spawned N children.
- `AgentExpansion(spawner_id, segments)` — AGENT paused K times; one segment per pause.

Nested expansions (a REF inside a cloned child, an inner MAP, etc.) appear as
children of their enclosing descriptor — uniform recursion at any depth.

    """One pause segment of an AGENT expansion.

    full re-entry frame: memo, iterations, pending, llm_config, tools, controls, mode).

    `children` is RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE — today no node kind nested inside the
    resumed AgentNode emits a non-AGENT Enqueue
    (`agent_compose/nodes/agent/modes/tool_calling.py:127` only emits
    AGENT-target pairs), so `children` is always [] and `_replay_expansions` folds
    over an empty list for AGENT segments. Kept as a slot so the descriptor shape can
    absorb a future REF-from-tool feature without a CHECKPOINT_VERSION migration;
    `_replay_expansions` already threads `is_top_level=False` into this slot so such a
    future child would nest correctly (it would NOT be promoted to a top-level ledger entry).
