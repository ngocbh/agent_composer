"""START_ID — the flow's parameter-binding boundary, internal-only. PURE.

The loader synthesizes ONE StartNode per flow from its `input:` decls; it is the flow's single
root. `self.params` are the input NAMES (ParamDecl per input) so the engine's eval_node ->
bind_params reads START_ID's sources from flow.wiring[START_ID] (top-level: the run-arg seed;
child: the call-arg edges). `run(record)` = coerce_inputs + e08 shape-check + apply_defaults,
returning the bound input record as ONE object keyed by input name -> store[<start id>], the
`inputs`-namespace replacement (binding at the boundary, not the driver).

NO asserts on START_ID: boundary asserts stay at run.py (top-level) + the eager
_apply_enqueue temp-pool (child). NOT START_ID's job: system/clock/run_id. Hidden from
authors: a reserved __-prefixed id, never parseable.
