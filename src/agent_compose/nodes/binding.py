"""Input binding — resolve a node's declared params into a typed input record (the read boundary).

The node/flow split: a node declares its signature as `ParamDecl`s (name + required/default/type,
NO source); the flow owns the sources in `CompiledFlow.wiring[node_id][param]`. `bind_params`
joins each `ParamDecl` to its `wiring[name]` source (an `expr.template` value — a whole `${...}`
resolved against the pool with type preserved, an embedded `${...}` stringified, or a literal),
building the `{name: value}` record the engine's `eval_node` hands the node instead of the pool.
Type-checking reuses the `shape_for` / `build_segment_with_type` helpers and stays lenient
on record / variant types that can't resolve against the empty registry.

A MAP body binds a per-element `item` scope: `${item}` / `${item.path}` resolve from the current
element passed via the `item=` kwarg (a body-local scope, NOT a pool head). The default (`item`
unset) is the ordinary non-MAP bind path.

Imports `expr` (parse_binding / eval_binding / resolve_reference) + `state` (shape_for /
build_segment_with_type); both sit below/beside `nodes` in the layer ladder.
