"""ask_user — a control tool: the agent asks the human a question mid-loop.

Bound to the model as `ask_user(question: str)`. When the model calls it, the
`tool_calling` loop suspends with `HumanInputRequired` instead of executing
locally; on resume the user's answer is fed back as the tool result. Schema only —
the function body is never invoked; the loop intercepts the call.

Model-chosen, NOT forced: granting `ask_user` only *enables* the capability — the
agent asks **only when the model decides it needs to** (so it's non-deterministic;
guide it via the prompt). For a guaranteed, deterministic pause (a mandatory human
gate that *always* suspends at a fixed point in the graph), use the `HUMAN_INPUT`
node (`agent_compose/nodes/human_input/`) instead.
