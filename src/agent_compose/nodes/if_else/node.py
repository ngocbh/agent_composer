"""IF_ELSE — deterministic conditional routing.

Strict (a pure function of its declared inputs): the node declares `inputs` (bound
via `from:` like any leaf), and each case's `when:` interpolates only those inputs
as bare `${name}`, evaluated against the **bound input record**, not the pool.
Routing is purely deterministic: the engine makes no LLM decision here. To branch
on a judgment, an upstream node produces a variable (e.g. a classifier AGENT
writing a label, or a CODE node a number) which the IF_ELSE binds as an input and
the case compares. Cases are tried in order; the first truthy one wins. If none
match, the reserved `"default"` handle is taken.

The node writes no state — it returns the selected handle on its result, and the
engine's `_branch` does the skip-flood.
