"""MODEL — an ML-inference node (kind kept; serving seam not wired yet).

A MODEL node holds a `model_id` (+ optional weights/runtime hints) and is meant to
delegate the actual inference to an injected ML-serving seam — the MODEL analogue of
AGENT's LLM. That seam (`model_runtime`) was never threaded through the loader/run path
(it was dead plumbing), so it was removed; the MODEL **node kind** stays a first-class,
parseable/buildable kind, but running one raises until a real serving seam is re-added.

When ML serving lands, re-introduce an injected `model_runtime(ctx) -> value` seam
(threaded `load_flow`/`run_flow` -> build -> node, and into REF/MAP baked children) and
have `run` call it over the node's bound input record.
