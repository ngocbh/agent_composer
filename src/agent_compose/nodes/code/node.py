"""CODE — run a deterministic Python callable referenced as `module:function`.

The function is called with its **bound typed input record** (a dict of the
node's declared inputs, resolved from their `from:` sources) — *not* the whole
pool — and returns the node's **one output value** (a scalar, list, or object;
"several outputs" = one object):

    def my_step(inputs: dict) -> Any: ...

The leaf function thus sees only its declared inputs (a pure function); the engine's
`eval_node` seam builds the record (the read boundary) and hands it in as `inputs`.

Inline source execution (the old engine's `exec` path) is intentionally *not*
supported here — it was the known sandbox-security gap. A `module:function`
reference keeps CODE deterministic and import-auditable; a real sandboxed inline
runtime is a separate, deliberate piece of work.
