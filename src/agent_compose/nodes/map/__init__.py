"""MAP — the `List.map` driver (`kind: map` + `over:`), internal-only build target.

Charter: this package owns the `MapNode` that maps a callable over a list. It is the MAP half of
the REF/MAP pair re-split out of the unified CALL node — `kind: map` builds a `MapNode`, `kind: call`
builds REF's `CallNode` (`nodes.call`). The two are distinct typed drivers; `MapNode`
discriminates by KIND (`NodeKind.MAP`), carries NO `over` attribute, and the iteration SOURCE rides
`flow.wiring[id]["over"]`. `run` returns a `list[Enqueue]` (one per element) for the engine's
`_apply_enqueue` MAP arm to splice into the live graph.

Imports flow one way: `nodes.base` (peer) + a deferred `state.seeding` import inside `run`
(matching `nodes.call`, keeping the ladder clean). `compose.build`'s `build_call_node` is the caller.
