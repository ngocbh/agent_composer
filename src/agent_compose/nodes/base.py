"""The Node base contract — the single most portable idea from graphon.

A node is a **pure function of its bound input record**: it implements
`run(inputs, **caps) -> NodeResult` and returns ONE of the closed sum
`Output | Pause | Enqueue` (the node-result sum type) — **or**, for a streaming
kind, a generator that yields `StreamChunk` and then *returns* a `NodeResult`.
The node never receives the pool: the engine's `runtime.eval_node` seam binds its
inputs (the read boundary) and hands it a record. The one effectful kind that still
needs a narrow capability is a mapped `call` (`bind_item`, a keyword-only arg); every other kind
takes only `inputs`. Failure is **not** a variant — a failing node `raise`s and the
engine boundary turns it into `NodeFailed`. A returned `Pause` becomes one
`PauseRequested`; the engine delivers the answer as the parked leaf's `Output`
(deliver-as-Output — the node never re-runs). A streaming kind is a generator that
yields `StreamChunk` and *returns* its `NodeResult` (drained by `_drain_node_generator`).

Invariant: a node never writes the pool. It *describes* its one output value as
`Output(value)`; the engine performs the write under `node_id`. Keeps nodes pure.
