"""WAIT — the internal suspend-until primitive (two modes).

Not exposed to flow authors directly: the WATCH composite is built from the event
mode, and a timed pause is built from the timed mode. The mode is selected by
which field is authored:

- `event_spec` set -> EVENT mode: suspend with `EventAwaited(node_id=self.id)` until
  the host watcher delivers the event payload as this node's `Output` (a
  `DeliverAnswerCommand`) and resumes the run.
- `until` set -> TIMED mode: resolve the `${...}` binding to an ISO timestamp and
  suspend with `ScheduledPause(resume_at=ts, node_id=self.id)`. Resume is
  command-driven — the host releases the wait by delivering `value=None` as this
  node's `Output`; the engine never reads wall-clock. `date`/`datetime` segments
  resolve to ISO strings, so the resolver accepts a str directly.

Both mirror HUMAN_INPUT's deliver-as-Output model: the node ALWAYS pauses on
its single run; the engine delivers the answer — no re-run.
